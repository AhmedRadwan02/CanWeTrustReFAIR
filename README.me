# CanWeTrustReFAIR: A Replication Study

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to replicating and building upon **ReFAIR**, a Context-Aware Recommender for Fairness Requirements Engineering. Our goal is to explore fairness in requirements engineering by reproducing the findings of the original work and identifying opportunities for further improvement.

Through this replication, we aim to:
- Deepen our understanding of fairness challenges in requirements engineering.
- Evaluate the original framework's effectiveness and identify potential enhancements.
- Propose and implement improvements to make fairness-aware recommendations more reliable and impactful.
